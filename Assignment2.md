# Assignment 2

It seemed that the area with the most 311 complaints was the area immediately west of Central Park. I’m not quite sure why this is, but it could be because that’s just a particularly active section of central park. Maybe it has a high concentration of people walking their dogs, construction, and food trucks, which seemed to be the noise sources with the most complaints generally. One thing that surprised me was that barking dogs were the main cause of noise complaints, while this does make sense given how common dogs are in New York City, it was still surprising to see, especially when other animal noises accounted for very few noise complaints. 
The data I chose to add was green spaces in New York City because I wanted to see if there were more food truck and dog-related noise complaints in areas around parks and green spaces. After looking at my final map it does look like there is some correlation between green spaces, and dog and food truck-related noise complaints.
